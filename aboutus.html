       <h1> Web Designing</h1>
       Web design refers to the design of websites. It usually refers to the user experience aspects
       of website development rather than software development. Web design used to be focused on 
       designing websites for desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile 
       and tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly important.<br>

       <br>A web designer works on a website's appearance, layout, and, in some cases, content.
       Appearance relates to the colors, typography, and images used.

       Layout refers to how information is structured and categorized.
       A good web design is easy to use, aesthetically pleasing, and
       suits the user group and brand of the website.<br>

      <br> A well-designed website is simple and communicates clearly to avoid confusing users. It wins and
       fosters the target audience's trust, removing as many potential points of user frustration as possible.
